## [0.1.0] - 2023-09-20
### Added
- Initial version of the AAC dataset containing child utterances extracted from .cha files
- Implementation of the sentence cleaning and preprocessing process
- Creation of telegraphic versions of the sentences
- Calculation of complexity metrics for original and telegraphic sentences
- Initial statistics by age group

### Features
- Dataset contains X sentences from Y different children
- Age range covered: Z to W years
- Complexity metrics include: number of tokens, lexical diversity, average word length, etc.

### Known Limitations
- Current dataset focuses solely on the English language
- Potential underrepresentation of complex sentences due to filtering process
- Lack of full conversational context

### Next Steps
- Expand the dataset to include more languages
- Improve the algorithm for generating telegraphic sentences
- Add more linguistic complexity metrics
- Implement a manual validation process for a sample of sentences
